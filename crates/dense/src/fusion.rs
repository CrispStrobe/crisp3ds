//! Depth fusion into a truncated signed distance volume: port of `Stereo.tsdf`
//! from `scripts/turntable_mesh/multiscale_stereo.py`.
//!
//! Every hull voxel is projected into every view on the GPU; votes are added in

//! in chunks and depth maps in batches that fit one storage binding, so the
//! default WebGPU limits are enough for any grid and view count.
