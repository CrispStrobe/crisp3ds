The table shows one seed's counts; all three frozen seeds produced the same
estimate within numerical precision for these inputs. `E` is essential
RANSAC inliers, `H` is competing homography inliers, and parallax is the median angle between rotated bearing
rays among cheirality-positive points. It is not a measured triangulated
depth. `Unavailable` means at least one preset reliability gate failed; for
both near rows, middle 036/126, and three of the four opposing pair-arm rows,
the median parallax was below 1°. Near 006/012 also has only 77/131
cheirality-positive E inliers (58.8%) and near 012/018 only 58/123 (47.2%);
opposing 036/222 has 13/24 (54.2%). Each falls below the fixed 60%
cheirality fraction gate. These angles must not be read as reliable
near-identity pose measurements. The original database configurations for
these pairs were `PLANAR_OR_PANORAMIC` (6) or `UNCALIBRATED` (3); neither
label supplies an independent pose.

The apparent SAM `030/198` opposing-pair 89.10° result passes the predeclared
numeric gates, but a read-only exact feature-index comparison found its 26
verified correspondences contain all 25 cached correspondences plus just one
new pair, indices `(232,26)`. That single addition coincides with the
essential solution changing from a low-parallax 1.68° fit to 89.10°.
The frozen protocol does not permit dropping the point or choosing another
fit. This correspondence sensitivity makes the 89.10° result weak evidence
of physical rotation despite its within-database three-seed stability. It
does not verify the physical rotation implied by the acquisition separation.
The middle `012/336` SAM row likewise adds one verified match to the cached
41, and both middle fits pass the declared gates at different angles.

Thus the selected long-separation verified matches do not independently
establish either a physically distinct opposing-view rotation or a true
near-identity collapse. One long SAM essential estimate supports a distinct
rotation under fixed assumed intrinsics and the rigid-scene model, while the
other three long pair-arm estimates are unavailable. Repeated texture,
planarity, low parallax, and an uncalibrated fixed initial focal length can
make an essential solution misleading. The database `qvec/tvec` defaults and
final reconstructed camera poses were not used as measured relative poses;
no scanner, depth, held-out images, or supplied Berkeley poses entered the
fit. The diagnostic neither validates physical camera orientation nor proves
why the 48-view SfM trajectory folded.
