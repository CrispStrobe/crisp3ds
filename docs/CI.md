# Continuous integration

All workflows run on GitHub-hosted runners, without secrets, signing identities
or store uploads. Hosted runners have **no usable GPU**: everything below is a
CPU result. `--device mps` and `--device cuda` of the dense pipeline, and
anything that needs the development datasets, are not tested in CI.

| Workflow | File | Runs on | Triggered by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| foundation | `.github/workflows/foundation.yml` | macOS, Linux, Windows | every push and pull request |
| dense pipeline | `.github/workflows/dense-pipeline.yml` | Linux, macOS arm64, Windows | `scripts/**`, manual |
| desktop app | `.github/workflows/desktop.yml` | Linux, macOS arm64, Windows | `apps/desktop/**`, manual |
| quality harness contracts | `.github/workflows/quality-harness.yml` | see file | selected `scripts/` and `tests/` paths |
| selected MVE CPU build | `.github/workflows/mve-selected.yml` | macOS, Linux, Windows | `scripts/mve_full/**`, manual |

## foundation: native core

The C++ core is built and tested here on all three systems; there is no
separate core workflow, because a second one would only repeat these steps.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build --config Release --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --build-config Release --output-on-failure
```

Proves: the core library, the `crisp3ds` CLI and the registered CTest cases
(`core_contract`, `cli_capabilities`, `cli_geometry`, `cli_unavailable`) build
and pass with the default options on each system.

On macOS only it additionally builds the pinned OpenCV backend
(`-DCRISP3DS_WITH_OPENCV=ON`), runs the stereo evaluator regression, the
desktop typecheck/tests/bundle, the shared contract parity check, the whole
`scripts/` unittest discovery with a small pinned dependency set (NumPy, Pillow,
pycolmap, OpenCV; **no SciPy, scikit-image or Torch**, so tests that need those
skip there and run in the dense pipeline workflow instead) and
`cargo check --locked` of the Tauri shell.

Does not prove: the OpenCV backend on Linux or Windows.

## dense pipeline

Python 3.11 with `scripts/turntable_mesh/requirements-dense.txt`. On Linux and
Windows Torch comes from the CPU wheel index, so no CUDA runtime is downloaded.

1. `ruff check scripts/turntable_mesh`
2. unit tests: `test_multiscale_stereo`, `test_tsdf_hull_mesh`,
   `test_turntable_rig`, `test_scan_evaluate`, `test_dense_pipeline`
3. the README "Quick start": `synthetic_scene`, then `dense_pipeline --device cpu`
   on the analytic sphere, followed by a check that `pipeline.json` says
   `complete` and the mesh is closed
4. artifact `dense-smoke-<os>`: `check/preview.png`, `check/result.json`,
   `pipeline.json`, `mesh/result.json`, `config.json` and the stage logs

Proves: the whole driver (four stage processes, one interpreter) works on the
three systems on CPU, including the deadline handling of a stage and its child
processes (process group on POSIX, `taskkill /T` on Windows).

Does not prove: MPS or CUDA execution, speed, memory use at real photo sizes,
the AliceVision input stage (`dense_all_views_inputs` is not run by the smoke,
which starts from an inputs directory), or reconstruction quality on real
objects. The sphere is a plumbing test, not a quality gate.

Locally, in one environment that has all requirements:

```sh
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD
python -m pip install -r scripts/turntable_mesh/requirements-dense.txt ruff
ruff check scripts/turntable_mesh
python -m unittest scripts.turntable_mesh.test_multiscale_stereo scripts.turntable_mesh.test_tsdf_hull_mesh \
  scripts.turntable_mesh.test_turntable_rig scripts.turntable_mesh.test_scan_evaluate \
  scripts.turntable_mesh.test_dense_pipeline
python -m scripts.turntable_mesh.synthetic_scene --output /tmp/sphere
python -m scripts.turntable_mesh.dense_pipeline --inputs /tmp/sphere --output /tmp/sphere-run \
  --device cpu --set sizes=64,128 --set grid=96 --set planes=48 --set neighbours=4 --set best_of=2 \
  --set vote_neighbours=4 --set min_votes=2,2 --set crop_padding=6 --set hull_dilate=1 \
  --set windows=5,7 --set aggregates=1,1
```

With the two development environments, run the unit tests once with each
interpreter (tests whose libraries are missing skip) and give the driver
`CRISP3DS_PYTHON` and `CRISP3DS_TORCH_PYTHON` as described in
`scripts/turntable_mesh/README.md`.

## desktop app

- **web bundle** (Linux): `npm ci`, `npm test`, `npm run build`; uploads
  `apps/desktop/dist` as artifact `crisp3ds-web`.
- **native** (macOS arm64, Windows, Linux): `npm ci`, `npm test`,
  `npx tauri build --no-bundle --ci -- --locked`; uploads the bare executable as
  `crisp3ds-desktop-<os>-unsigned`. Linux installs WebKitGTK 4.1, GTK 3,
  libayatana-appindicator, librsvg, libxdo and OpenSSL headers first.
- **android / ios** (manual, `mobile=true`, non-blocking): unsigned debug
  probes only; see the TODO block in the workflow file.

Proves: the committed frontend and Rust shell compile and link in release mode
on the three desktop systems with the locked dependencies.

Does not prove: that the window opens or the UI works (nothing is launched),
installers (`bundle.active` is `false`, so no `.dmg`, `.msi`, `.deb` or
AppImage is produced), code signing, notarisation, or any store submission. The
uploaded executables are unsigned; macOS Gatekeeper and Windows SmartScreen will
object to them.

Locally:

```sh
cd apps/desktop
npm ci
npm test
npm run build                                  # web bundle in dist/
npx tauri build --no-bundle -- --locked        # native shell in src-tauri/target/release/
```

### Not done yet

- **GitHub Pages**: the web bundle is only an artifact. Publishing needs Pages
  enabled in the repository settings, a build with `vite build --base=/crisp3ds/`
  (the default base `/` breaks asset URLs under a project path) and a deploy
  job with `pages: write` and `id-token: write`.
- **Installers**: set `bundle.active` to `true` (and choose targets), then drop
  `--no-bundle`. Signing is separate: Developer ID certificate plus notarisation
  credentials on macOS, a code-signing certificate on Windows.
- **Mobile**: see the workflow TODO. Release builds need an Android keystore
  and, for iOS, an Apple Developer team, certificate and provisioning profile.
