# Mustard TRAIN two-view estimator robustness result

The approved batch followed the [frozen plan](MUSTARD-USAC-ROBUSTNESS-PLAN.md).
The [external JSON report](/Volumes/backups/code/crisp3ds-data/mustard-usac-robustness-001.json)
completed in 1.272 seconds, is 1,139,483 bytes, and has SHA-256
`6128531963bfd236dbc1ddad1b83c5d7db266fd7feef11ae87bec8df14af2080`.
It used the pinned Python environment with OpenCV 4.10.0 and NumPy 1.26.4.
All six sealed TRAIN pairs in both arms received full-input fits in blob,
canonical, and reverse-canonical order. The stronger middle pair and both
opposing pairs also received three preselected leave-one-out removals per
arm in each order. Blob and canonical orders were identical on all rows;
reverse-canonical supplied the actual order perturbation.

The table gives the blob-order full-input status, an angle only when the
existing gates accepted a `distinct` or `near_identity` fit, the maximum
numerical rotation difference across full-input orders, and the maximum
same-order full-versus-removal rotation difference. Numerical spreads include
rotations from abstained fits and are diagnostics, not accepted poses.
`Abstain B; L` counts unavailable or indeterminate fits among the three
baseline orders and nine sampled removal/order fits. A dash under LOO means
that pair was outside the frozen removal panel. `USAC D/F/A` groups
`USAC_DEFAULT`, `USAC_FAST`, and `USAC_ACCURATE`: their complete recorded
method objects, including every per-seed count, angle, parallax, status,
homography count, order result, removal result, and summary, were exactly
equal on all 12 pair-arm rows. This is an observed equality on this panel,
not a general equivalence of the three algorithms.

Across all 36 ordered baseline fits and 54 ordered removal fits per method,
the accepted-fit counts were RANSAC 15/36 and 21/54; each of the three
identical USAC D/F/A variants 19/36 and 23/54; and MAGSAC 13/36 and
24/54. Acceptance means the fixed numeric gates passed; it does not measure
physical accuracy. On SAM opposing 030/198, MAGSAC's accepted 69.00° fit
was stable under these sampled order/removal changes, whereas RANSAC's
accepted 89.10° full fit abstained on all nine sampled removals. MAGSAC
also had rotation differences above 140° on other sampled pairs. The
method comparison does not establish a generally robust estimator or a
true object rotation, and a larger perturbation sample could change the
stability ranking.
