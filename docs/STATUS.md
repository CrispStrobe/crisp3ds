# Status

State of Crisp3DS / Crisp 3D Studio on 2026-10-08. The plan of record is
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md); measurements and settings are in the
[crate README](../crates/dense/README.md).

## What works

| Area | State |
| --- | --- |
| **Photos to STL, one command** | `crisp3ds-dense run --photos DIR --calibration JSON --output RUN`: threshold masks, our own turntable camera solver, GPU dense stages, closed STL. No Python, no external program. About 50–100 s per 73-photo object on an Apple M1 |
| **Native crate** (`crates/dense`, Rust + wgpu) | The primary implementation. Metal, Vulkan, DirectX 12 and WebGPU; library API, C interface, event log contract; Python package kept as the reference it was ported from |
| **Browser** | The same pipeline as WebAssembly + WebGPU, from photos or from prepared inputs, single-threaded or threaded (cross-origin isolated pages). Default Bunny from 73 photos in Chrome: measured 130–264 s with 4 threads, peak WebAssembly memory about 1.6–2.1 GiB. Live at <https://crispstrobe.github.io/crisp3ds/> |
| **Crisp 3D Studio** (app) | Desktop (macOS, Windows, Linux), iOS and Android from one code base (Tauri 2); the engine runs in-process. Start from photos with provider choice, live progress, preview surfaces, diagnostic sheets, per-step inspection sheets, example objects downloaded on request. Release [v0.2.0](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/crisp3ds/releases/tag/v0.2.0) (prerelease, unsigned desktop builds); internal TestFlight builds for iOS and macOS |
| **Masks** | `threshold` (default; contact shadow removed), `import`, `sam` (SAM 2.1 natively through ONNX Runtime or CrispEmbed's ggml engine, optional build feature), `external-sam` (PyTorch) |
| **Cameras** | `turntable` (default; our own solver, pure Rust, repeatable), `markers` (printed mat, gives scale and handedness; validated on renders only), `colmap`, `alicevision`, `import`; `--capture orbit` for camera paths that are not one ring |
| **Evaluation** | Scanner F1 against independent scans (3DLF), DTU protocol, Google Scanned Objects rendered by our own renderer (`crisp3ds-dense render`), per-step inspection sheets in every run |

## Measured results (default command, from photos)

F1 at 0.5 % of the scan diagonal, whole surface / above the support; scans used
for scoring only. Exact numbers per threshold and per commit are in the crate
README.

| Object (3DLF, 73 photos) | F1 at 0.5 % |
| --- | --- |
| Bunny | about 0.90 / 0.96 |
| Armadillo | about 0.92 / 0.95 |
| Dragon | about 0.80 / 0.85 |
| Lucy | about 0.85 / 0.88 |
| Thai statue | about 0.88 / 0.95 |
| Happy Buddha | about 0.79 / 0.83 |

| Other sets | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Google Scanned Objects renders (72 photos) | rhino 0.867, cereal box 0.833 at 0.5 % with threshold masks; light-coloured objects need better masks (Mario 0.71 → 0.83 with exact masks) |
| DTU historical dense-stage diagnostics (49 views, supplied masks; supplied or COLMAP poses) | 1.03–1.31 mm mean of accuracy and completeness on scans 63 and 65; these are not photo-only pipeline results |
| YCB turntable | cracker box 0.45 at 0.5 %; smooth objects (mustard bottle) refused by the camera gates |

## Findings worth knowing

- The 3DLF scans are mirror images of the photographed objects; our
  reconstructions have correct handedness (shown with an asymmetric synthetic
  object with known truth).
- PyTorch 2.7 on Apple MPS computes SAM 2.1's Hiera encoder wrongly (a strided
  `max_pool2d`); masks made that way before the fix were partly wrong.
- With correct arithmetic, SAM masks do not beat the threshold masks on this
  capture style; threshold is the default.
- The 3DLF light-field photos are soft (most image energy below an eighth of
  the sampling frequency). Fine relief is nevertheless visible in them and is
  poorly recovered. Per-pixel slanted-plane matching (PatchMatch-style,
  now excluded from ordinary builds pending patent review) reduces noise and improves some folds, but
  close-ups still show weak Bunny eyes, nose and head relief. Whole-object F1
  gains do not establish recovery of those features. Follow-up matching,
  fusion and smoothing experiments are recorded in
  [bunny-head-detail-review.json](../tests/evidence/bunny-head-detail-review.json);
  none was adopted as a default.
- At 10° steps (36 photos) results are almost as good as at 5°; at 15° steps
  low-texture objects fail camera recovery.

## In progress

- **Photo-textured GLB**: opt-in `run --texture` and standalone `texture`
  command, also offered in Studio for built-in engines. An embedded UV atlas
  uses the pipeline's own recovered cameras, photos and masks; unseen regions
  are grey. Geometry is preserved. Initial view-coherence/visibility checks
  reduce patchwork, but seams and captured-lighting differences remain.
  Studio now previews GLB on request and switches to grey on the same geometry;
  preview loading, closing, retry and cancellation were browser-tested.
  Full browser reconstruction/texturing memory and real-device sharing
  still need validation. Fresh Rhino: 72/72 photos, 96 s including initial
  texturing; mustard stops before stereo because threshold masks select the
  undistortion border. [Usage and limits](TEXTURED-MESH.md),
  [photo-only evidence](../tests/evidence/photo-texture-review.json).

- **Facial detail and source review**: optional neighboring-plane PatchMatch
  is excluded from ordinary engine builds and settings forms. The explicit
  `research-patchmatch` Cargo feature retains it for research, without granting
  patent rights. A targeted [source and patent screen](../tests/evidence/mvs-source-review.json)
  records the relevant claims and the limits of the review; it is not legal
  clearance. The default band pipeline remains unchanged.
  Independent per-pixel plane refinement is implemented as an experiment
  (`slanted_refine=false` by default), with no neighboring-plane candidates or
  random perturbation. Historical saved Bunny eye/brow-region F1 at 0.1% of the object diagonal
  rises from 0.579 to 0.593, below the earlier research PatchMatch result of
  0.609. Close-ups still show weak eyes and nose. Supplied scanner geometry is
  used only for posthoc evaluation, never reconstruction.
  Optional subpixel fusion (`fusion_interpolate=false`) raises the combined
  local eye-region F1 to 0.601. Neither experiment has passed the six-object
  adoption gate; both stay off. [Evidence and limits](../tests/evidence/bunny-independent-detail-review.json).
- **Example objects in the app** from several sources (CC BY renders first).
  The rhino passed the sandboxed Mac app check (72 registered photos).
  Screenshot capture now selects the viewer's upright direction for this
  object; the corrected iOS/Mac screenshot dry run and Pages check remain
  pending CI. No screenshots have been uploaded to App Store Connect.

## Known limits

- Masks assume a dark object on a light backdrop; light-coloured objects and
  dark backdrops need SAM or imported masks. Threshold masks covering over
  90% of every photo are refused before camera recovery, with a mask sheet
  kept for inspection.
- Interiors a single ring of cameras never sees (mugs, shoes) are capped.
- Thin, low-texture parts and very smooth objects remain hard.
- The marker mat has not been tested with a real print.
- Builds have been run on Apple hardware only (desktop app, iOS simulator,
  browser); Windows, Linux and Android builds are tested in CI only, and no
  real iPhone or iPad has run the app yet.

Photo robustness follow-up (2026-10-08): opt-in background-colour masks and an
experimental rotating-support camera initializer; defaults unchanged. Shoe
and Mario produce STL and GLB with identical triangle geometry. Mario with
photo-derived native SAM masks scores F1 0.830 at 0.5% of reference diagonal;
shoe gains are modest. Mustard now registers with photo-derived masks and
surface features, but its wrinkled mesh fails visual review. It is not fixed.
See [other image sets](OTHER-IMAGE-SETS.md) and the
[regression runner](../scripts/photo_regression/README.md).
A silhouette-only mustard control yields a useful coarse closed bottle and GLB
(F1 0.637/0.836/0.890), versus 0.181/0.391/0.658 for its damaged stereo mesh.
The current dense evidence damages the coarse hull; this does not distinguish
camera error, matching, filtering or fusion. The approximation still loses
neck/spout geometry and unseen concavities.
Cereal box: 72/72 recovered cameras and both exports; background masks retain
the disk, while SAM removes it but misses pale edges. Printed lines still become
false grooves. A local combined-mask/silhouette prototype is closed genus 0,
but facets and texture defects remain; it is not a shipped/general fix. Drill
is still refused by camera gates. Evaluation warnings no longer infer which
input is mirrored from a preferred reflected shape fit alone.


Quality follow-up (2026-10-08): source-photo annotations corrected partly
offset eye/nose depth boxes. New stage profiles report coverage and errors
on common rays, with scanner geometry used only for evaluation. In one nose
view, independent-plane depth coverage falls from 93.7% before cross-view
filtering to 58.2% afterwards; weak/noisy relief is already present before that
filter. This does not isolate cameras, matching and appearance errors.
Adaptive spatial/intensity support takes 248 s of refinement versus 75 s for
the control, without convincing recovery of the eyes/nose. Geometric-confidence
fusion also leaves the difficult structural failures unresolved. Those dense
experiments were not adopted; the original matcher was retained after its
shortcut showed no reliable speed gain.

New standalone texture options `--coherent --color-balance` preserve every
triangle coordinate and winding byte in five reviewed exports. Source-view
boundaries decrease about 12–17%; visible seams remain. Twenty-four views
reduce some grey seams on the cereal approximation, but do not fix its shape,
and increase atlas pixels 56%. Both new controls and SAM's experimental
`--sam-prompt-mask background` stay opt-in. On drill, multiple-candidate SAM
finishes all 60 masks but includes support/background in several views; camera
recovery still fails its unchanged support gate (24.8%, required 25%).
No drill mesh is accepted. Reserved-track mustard camera diagnostics and
all experiment limits are in the [quality review](../tests/evidence/quality-followup-review.json)
and [diagnostic usage](../scripts/photo_regression/README.md).


Drill continuation: enabling existing automatic SAM cues with background
prompts and several candidates now recovers 60/60 cameras from the same
cached own RGB matches, with the 25% support gate unchanged (25.42% support).
The first textured GLB renders correctly, but its grey mesh is pitted/open
and fails the detail target. Independent planes and a 12-degree minimum
neighbor-angle control do not resolve the openings; no default changed.
See [drill controls](../tests/evidence/drill-cues-and-detail-controls.json) and
[other image sets](OTHER-IMAGE-SETS.md#drill-recovery-control-with-automatic-cues).


Drill failure isolation: a fresh baseline reproduces the STL byte for byte.
Raw finest depth estimates already omit broad casing regions and have
irregular slopes. Finest consistent median coverage is 51.4%; coarse fallback
raises it to 71.5%. A diagnostic mesh using only the existing silhouette prior
(no accepted stereo weights, unseen closure enabled, overshoot disabled)
keeps a recognizable coarse shape without the deep pits. It still misses real
surface detail and is not an accepted reconstruction. This points to unreliable
stereo/fusion evidence as a major contributor rather than texture export alone.
The held-out camera subset has 58 foreground observations, median/p95
0.445/1.501 px; the full foreground set is much worse, and background matches
include many outliers. Cycle-confirmed training matches do not improve the
full foreground holdout and were not adopted. Photo-only mask grouping is now
available in the camera diagnostic. See the
[depth failure evidence](../tests/evidence/drill-depth-failure-diagnostic.json).


### Original texture RGB and drill controls (2026-10-08)

New photo-stage runs keep matching contrast separate from captured colour:
`texture_image` names the original RGB, undistorted with the same recovered
lens. Legacy scenes still fall back to their matching image. A 60-view native
control preserved every camera parameter and matching-image byte while its
texture pixels matched the original captures. The GLB preserved all 1,006,012
triangle coordinates and winding, and passed format validation. The full
threaded browser run passed too; see [texture evidence](../tests/evidence/original-texture-rgb.json).
This fixes the colour source; the drill's geometry remains unacceptable.

Original-RGB matching, frozen-prior geometric cost, reduced free-space carving,
a full native sweep and Poisson reconstruction from our own filtered depths did
not meet the drill shape target. Object-only COLMAP registered 44/60 and failed
the existing camera gate; unmasked COLMAP could not initialize a model. No gate
was relaxed and no dense default changed. [Recorded controls](../tests/evidence/drill-matching-controls.json)
retain the rendered comparison paths and limitations; these are negative
results, not an accepted quality improvement or six-object adoption validation.

### Depth reliability experiments (2026-10-09)

A private Apache-2.0 DA3-Small experiment produced smoother drill surfaces,
but reduced strict reference F1 from 0.386 to 0.300 at 0.5% of the reference
diagonal. The reference was used only for posthoc evaluation. Cross-view
agreement and smooth appearance did not establish correct shape; the learned
prior and its refinement controls were rejected. No model code, weights or
new dependency was shipped. See the [learned-depth review](../tests/evidence/learned-depth-drill-review.json)
for pinned sources, resource limits and evaluation qualifications.

A first NCC uniqueness filter improved drill F1 but severely damaged Bunny,
including its eye region. It confused broad single peaks with competing
depths and failed the default adoption gate. It was rejected; see the
[confidence review](../tests/evidence/peak-confidence-review.json).
Dense defaults remain unchanged.

The revised experimental `peak_min_margin=0.02` requires two distinct local
maxima separated by a real score valley, preserving broad single peaks.
All six RGB-derived object pairs pass the 0.003 F1 regression gate, with paired
renders reviewed. Drill strict F1 improves 0.386 to 0.409; Bunny's tight eye
region changes 0.582 to 0.586, without convincing eyes/nose recovery. The
portable native implementation reproduces both experimental STLs byte for
byte, and its disabled control reproduces the original drill STL. This is an
opt-in reliability experiment, not an accepted drill reconstruction.
The threaded browser executes all 60 photos through cameras, stereo, mesh,
check and textured GLB export with this setting: 52.7 seconds and 1.07 GiB
WASM high water in one local Chrome/Metal run with two workers. These are
execution measurements, not browser/GPU RSS or a controlled speed comparison.

Separate posthoc comparison with supplied YCB camera poses measures median
0.376-degree rotation error relative to the first recovered camera, and 4.0 mm
translation residual after one scale fit. Adjacent-view errors are smaller
(median 0.079 degrees / 1.17 mm). The supplied calibration has its own error;
these measurements do not establish which error causes the bad depths.
Projecting our own cameras onto a rigid ring improves some neighbouring-pose
statistics but worsens independent held-out foreground photo residuals; it
was rejected. Supplied poses never entered reconstruction or the ring fit.
See [distinct-mode and camera evidence](../tests/evidence/distinct-depth-modes-review.json).
The final rigid-ring mesh control changes strict F1 only 0.409 to 0.412,
with extensive visible defects remaining. A separate control removes grazing
depth normals beyond 60 degrees (333,764 of 1,114,571 valid depth pixels),
then repeats fusion on the same own inputs; it also leaves extensive defects.
Neither control is adopted. No reference F1 or six-object gate was measured
for the grazing-normal control.

Subpixel refinement of own drill feature matches was rejected: on a fixed
held-out foreground subset, median residual changes 0.445 to 0.422 pixels,
but p95 worsens 1.501 to 1.542 pixels and the full foreground median worsens
1.000 to 1.023 pixels. The camera diagnostic now supports fixed eligibility
from a separate own baseline solve and reports invalid selected observations.
Both solves must exclude the same reserved training components. Five tests
cover selection independence, view ordering and invalid observations.
See [camera subpixel review](../tests/evidence/camera-subpixel-review.json).

A private source-occlusion control rejects samples lying more than 0.5%
behind our previous-pass source depth. Separately fitted drill strict F1 changes 0.409 to
0.422, but the fixed-alignment follow-up below does not confirm that gain;
pits, false relief and an open mesh persist. Bunny passes
its numerical regression check; eye-region F1 changes 0.586 to 0.594 while
mean surface error worsens, and the renders do not show convincing eye/nose
recovery. Seven synthetic GPU cases pass and the disabled drill control
reproduces all final depths and the STL exactly. This control remains private:
no production integration, five other object checks or browser execution.
See [source visibility evidence](../tests/evidence/source-visibility-review.json).

Fixed-alignment follow-up corrects the interpretation of that visibility gain:
with one baseline scan fit and 200,000 samples per surface, strict drill F1
is 0.4108 for distinct modes, 0.4089 for visibility and 0.4097 for a new
conservative visibility control. The latter uses only accepted depths with
full coherent 3x3 support, never hole-filled initial surfaces; it worsens
all three drill thresholds and mean error. Both visibility variants are
rejected for integration. Bunny's conservative variant has only tiny local
changes, without convincing eye/nose restoration. Its prior-validity test
passes; no other-object or browser gate was run for these rejected controls.

A stronger drill lead is confidence for coarse fallback. On the same own depths,
replaying finest accepted depths alone changes fixed-alignment F1 at
0.5/1/2% from 0.411/0.637/0.821 to 0.453/0.699/0.925. Replaying merged
depths reproduces the baseline STL byte for byte. A private control keeps
coarse gap fills only when three finest-depth voters agree, preserving all
fine pixels and retaining 45,497 of 295,747 fallback candidates. Its F1 is
0.456/0.702/0.929 and symmetric mean surface error is about 24% lower than
ordinary fallback. Three identical-view renders were inspected. The meshes
remain open and visibly defective; this is a useful reliability lead, not an
accepted drill reconstruction. No default or app setting changes were made;
other-object validation, native parity and browser execution remain required.
See [supported fallback evidence](../tests/evidence/supported-fallback-review.json).

The supported-fallback STL also has a locally inspected original-RGB GLB;
all triangle coordinates/winding are byte-equal, source attribution is embedded,
and Khronos validation reports zero errors/warnings/infos/hints. About one
third of surface area remains untextured; seams and geometric defects persist.
This is standalone export/render validation, not browser pipeline adoption.
