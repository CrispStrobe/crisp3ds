# Engine contract for front ends

One front end is meant to serve macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android and the
web. Only desktop systems run the reconstruction; phones and browsers are
clients of a machine that does. This document is what a front end may rely on.
The reference implementation is `scripts/turntable_mesh/` (`dense_events.py`,
`dense_pipeline.py`, `engine_server.py`, `export_replay.py`).

## 1. A run is a directory

Everything about a run lives in one directory. A front end never needs
anything else.

```
<run>/
  events.jsonl          the event log (section 2)
  config.json           the resolved settings
  pipeline.json         stage commands, exit codes, timings, final status
  cancel                created by a client to ask the run to stop
  input-sheet.png
  stereo/  mask-repair.png  hull-vs-mask.png  depth-level-N.png  depth-merged.png
           preview/<name>/mesh.stl            coarse surfaces while matching runs
  mesh/    mesh.stl  result.json
  check/   photo-overlay.png  preview.png  result.json
  scan/    overlay.png  result.json           only when a reference scan was given
```

Three ways to reach it, all with the same content:

| Mode | Events | Files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local (desktop shell) | read `events.jsonl`, remember the line count | read from disk |
| HTTP (phone, browser, remote) | `GET /api/runs/<id>/events?since=N` | `GET /api/runs/<id>/files/<path>` |
| Replay (no engine) | fetch the bundle's `events.jsonl` once | fetch relative to the bundle |

A replay bundle is made with
`python -m scripts.turntable_mesh.export_replay --run <run> --output <bundle>`.
`tests/fixtures/dense-run-sphere/` is one (a synthetic sphere, 35 events, 6 MB).

## 2. Events

`events.jsonl` is append-only, one JSON object per line. A reader's position is
the number of lines consumed; over HTTP each event carries that line number as
`seq`. A last line without a newline is still being written and must be ignored.

Every event has `type`, `time` (Unix seconds) and `stage` (`inputs`, `stereo`,
`mesh`, `check`, `evaluate`, or null for run-level events).

| `type` | Other fields | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run_started` | `schema`, `configuration`, `device`, `inputs` | First event of every run. `schema` is `crisp3ds_dense_events_v1` |
| `stage_started` | | A stage began |
| `progress` | `fraction` (0..1 within the stage), `message` | For a progress bar and a status line |
| `metric` | `name`, `value` | A number worth showing, e.g. `coverage_level_1`, `silhouette_iou_median` |
| `artifact` | `kind`, `path` (relative to the run), `label`, optional `level`, `triangles` | A file is complete and can be shown |
| `stage_finished` | `seconds` | |
| `error` | `message` | A stage failed; `run_finished` follows |
| `run_finished` | `status` (`complete`, `failed`, `cancelled`), `seconds` | Last event |

Artifact kinds, in the order they normally appear:

| `kind` | File | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `input_sheet` | PNG | Evenly spaced photos with their mask outlines |
| `preview_volume` | NPZ | Internal. Ignore it; a `preview_mesh` follows |
| `preview_mesh` | binary STL | Coarse surface so far: the silhouette hull, the hull after mask repair, then the surface after each pyramid level except the last |
| `mask_repair_sheet` | PNG | Pixels that multi-view repair added to the masks, in green |
| `hull_mask_sheet` | PNG | Hull against masks: red where a mask is not covered, blue where the hull lies outside a mask |
| `depth_sheet` | PNG | Per level: photo, depth, depth shading for three views. `level` says which; the last one is the merged final depth |
| `final_mesh` | binary STL | The result at full resolution (can be 50 MB) |
| `photo_overlay` | PNG | Mesh outline against masks: green both, red mask only, blue mesh only |
| `preview_render` | PNG | Photos above, shaded reconstruction below |
| `scan_overlay` | PNG | Distance to an independent scan, when one was given |
| `report` | JSON | `mesh/result.json` (triangles, closedness, genus), `check/result.json` (silhouette agreement) and, if evaluated, `scan/result.json` |

Rules a front end can rely on:

- Every run that wrote `run_started` also writes `run_finished`, including when
  it fails before its first stage (an `error` event with the reason precedes it).
  Only a killed driver process can leave a log without it.
- `HEAD` works wherever `GET` does, so file sizes can be probed.
- An artifact event is written only after its file is complete.
- Preview meshes are produced by a side process and may arrive later than the
  matching events around them; order them by `seq`, show the newest.
- All meshes are in one coordinate frame, so a viewer can swap them without
  moving the camera. That frame has no physical scale and its up direction is
  arbitrary; a viewer should frame the bounding box.
- Unknown event types, artifact kinds and fields must be ignored, not treated
  as errors. New ones will be added without a schema change.

## 3. HTTP engine

`python -m scripts.turntable_mesh.engine_server --runs <dir> --data <dir> [--static <built front end>]`

| Request | Answer |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/health` | `{"schema", "device", "can_start_runs"}` |
| `GET /api/settings` | `{"settings": [{"name", "group", "meaning", "kind", "default"}]}`; `kind` is `boolean`, `integer`, `number`, `integer_list` or `number_list`. Enough to generate a settings form |
| `GET /api/data?path=<relative>` | `{"path", "entries": [{"name", "directory", "inputs"}]}`: folders under the data directory; `inputs` is true where a run can start |
| `GET /api/runs` | `{"runs": [{"id", "status", "started", "stage", "stage_fraction", "events"}]}`, newest first |
| `POST /api/runs` | Body below. `201 {"id"}` or `400 {"error"}` |
| `GET /api/runs/<id>/events?since=N` | `{"events": [...], "next": M}`; poll with `since=M`, about once a second |
| `POST /api/runs/<id>/cancel` | `{"id", "cancel_requested": true}`; the run ends with `run_finished` status `cancelled` |
| `GET /api/runs/<id>/files/<path>` | The file, or 404 |

Start body:

```json
{
  "name": "my dragon",
  "inputs": "dragon/inputs",
  "device": "mps",
  "settings": {"grid": 320, "sizes": [256, 512]},
  "reference": "dragon/scan.ply"
}
```

`inputs` may be replaced by `scene`, `prepared` and `raw_masks`. All paths are
relative to the engine's `--data` directory and are refused if they leave it.
`settings` keys are those of `GET /api/settings`; invalid values give a 400
before anything starts. `reference` is optional and is used only after the
reconstruction, for scoring.

Security model: the server binds to localhost by default. Bound to any other
address it requires `--token`, and clients send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
There is no TLS and there are no accounts; put it behind a reverse proxy or a
VPN for anything beyond a trusted network. CORS is open so a development front
end on another port can reach it.

## 4. Not in the contract yet

- **Photo upload and capture.** A phone cannot yet send photos; runs start from
  data already on the engine's machine. Planned as `POST /api/uploads`.
- **Camera recovery and segmentation.** Runs start from recovered cameras and
  masks. Those two steps exist as separate local drivers and are not yet stages
  of this pipeline, so "photos in, STL out" in one click is not available.
- **Push transport.** Clients poll. Server-sent events may be added; polling
  will keep working.
- **Mesh formats.** Only binary STL. A compact preview format (for example GLB
  with fewer triangles) may be added as an additional artifact kind.
