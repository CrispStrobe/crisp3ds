# Crisp3DS Studio

The front end for Crisp3DS's photo-to-STL reconstruction. It shows a run as it
happens: the stages, the surface getting better step by step in a 3D view, the
diagnostic sheets, and the numbers.

It gets its runs in four ways, all behind one interface and all following
[`docs/ENGINE-CONTRACT.md`](../../docs/ENGINE-CONTRACT.md):

- **In the app (Tauri)** the engine is built in: `crates/dense` runs inside
  the app, from an inputs folder, from cameras and masks, or **from plain
  turntable photos** when AliceVision or COLMAP is installed on the computer.
- **In a browser with WebGPU** the same engine runs in the page
  ("This browser"), from an inputs folder on the device. Nothing is uploaded.
- As a client of an **engine on some computer**, over HTTP.
- Playing back a **recorded run**.

It is one static web app. The same build is meant to be served by the engine,
hosted on any web server, and wrapped by Tauri 2 for desktop and mobile.

| Recorded run, desktop | Live engine run, phone |
| --- | --- |
| ![Run view of the demo recording](docs/replay-desktop.jpg) | ![Live run on a phone](docs/engine-live-phone.jpg) |

More screenshots are listed under [Verification](#verification).

## Running it

Node 22.18 or newer.

```sh
cd apps/studio
npm ci
npm run dev        # http://127.0.0.1:1430, demo served straight from tests/fixtures
npm run build      # typecheck, then static files in dist/
npm run preview    # serves dist/ on http://127.0.0.1:1431
npm run lint       # tsc --noEmit (strict)
npm test           # vitest
```

`dist/` uses relative URLs only and hash routes (`#/...`), so it works from any
base path without server rewrites: a site root, `https://user.github.io/repo/`,
the engine's `--static`, or a `tauri://` origin.

### Demo (no engine)

Open the app and choose **Play the demo**, or go to `#/replay`. The recording
is `tests/fixtures/dense-run-sphere/`, copied into `dist/demo/` at build time
(it is not duplicated in git).

### A recorded run (replay bundle)

Make a bundle with
`python -m scripts.turntable_mesh.export_replay --run <run> --output <bundle>`,
put it on any web server, and enter its address under **Recorded run**, or
open `#/replay?bundle=<address>`. The address may be relative to the app
(`big/`) or absolute. A bundle on another origin must be served with CORS
headers.

Playback follows the recorded timing. Speeds are 1×, 4×, 16× and instant (4× to
begin with; the choice is remembered). Pause, step one event forwards or
backwards, or drag the slider to any event; going backwards rebuilds the state
from the first event.

### A live engine

```sh
python -m scripts.turntable_mesh.engine_server --runs <dir> --data <dir> \
  --static apps/studio/dist --port 8765
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. Studio notices that an engine is serving the
page and offers its address; **Connect**, then start a run or open one. A
Studio served from elsewhere (the dev server, a phone on the same network)
connects the same way by typing the engine's address and, if the engine was
started with `--token`, the token.

The address and token are kept in this browser's `localStorage`. The token is
sent only in the `Authorization` header; it is never logged and never put in a
URL. With a token, images are fetched by script and shown through object URLs,
because an `<img>` cannot send the header.

## What it shows

- **Connection**: demo, a bundle address, or an engine (address and token).
- **Runs** (engine): status, the running stage with its progress, start time;
  refreshed every three seconds. **New run**: inputs folder and optional
  reference scan (typed, with suggestions for the folder being typed, or picked
  in a browser of the engine's data directory from `GET /api/data`, where
  folders a run can start from are marked), device, name, and a settings form
  generated from `GET /api/settings`
  (grouped by `group`, `meaning` as help text, one typed input per `kind`,
  lists as comma-separated values). Only values that differ from the defaults
  are sent. "Reset to defaults" and a per-field "Default: ..." link undo
  changes. A `400` from the engine is shown at the field(s) its sentence names
  and once at the form.
- **Run view**:
  - Stage timeline with state, elapsed time, progress and the latest message;
    overall status; cancel (engine); errors with the engine's message.
  - **Surface**: the newest `preview_mesh` / `final_mesh` appears by itself. A
    step strip goes back and forth between surfaces; picking one turns "Follow
    newest" off. The camera stays put when surfaces are swapped and frames the
    bounding box for the first one. Orbit, zoom and pan with mouse, touch or
    keyboard (arrows, `+`, `-`, `0`). Smooth or flat shading. Triangle count.
    "Up" offers ±X, ±Y, ±Z, because the model's frame has no fixed up
    direction; no units are shown, because it has no physical scale.
  - **Diagnostics**: every sheet as a card in arrival order, grouped by stage,
    depth sheets ordered by `level`. A card opens a full-window viewer with
    zoom and pan (wheel, pinch, drag, double-click, `+` `-` `0` `1`, `[` `]`
    for the neighbouring sheets).
  - **Numbers**: `metric` events (latest value per name) and the `report`
    artifacts: mesh report, photo check, scanner evaluation (F1 per threshold,
    accuracy and completeness medians, and the `warnings` text, which is where
    the handedness warning arrives). Unknown JSON is shown as written. Every
    report has its full JSON in a collapsible block.
- Light and dark themes following the system, with a toggle. Layout from
  360 px upwards. All controls are reachable by keyboard and have visible
  focus; images carry their artifact label as text alternative. No external
  requests: system fonts, inline icons, everything bundled.

### This browser (no engine, no upload)

On the **Connection** screen, "This browser" runs the reconstruction in the
page: `crates/dense/web` (the dense pipeline as WebAssembly, computing with
WebGPU) in a worker. Choose an inputs folder (`cameras.json`, the photos and
their masks, all inside the folder and named relative to it); the folder
dialog of the File System Access API is used where the browser has it, a
folder input otherwise. Files stay on disk and are read one at a time when the
engine asks. Events go through the same reducer as every other source;
sheets, reports and meshes come out of the engine's memory as object URLs,
which are revoked when the run view is left. The final STL and every sheet
have a **Download** button. Runs are gone when the page is closed.

- **WebGPU is required.** Without it the card says so and offers nothing.
  Current Chrome and Edge have it.
- **Memory.** WebAssembly can address 4 GiB. On the Bunny (73 photos of 2
  megapixels) the engine peaks at 1.9 GiB without intermediate surfaces and at
  2.5 GiB with them (the crate's figures; the first was measured again here).
  So above 60 megapixels in all, "Show intermediate surfaces while computing"
  is off by default, the form says why, and it can be switched on.
- **The engine is a separate file**, not part of the script bundle: the build
  copies `crates/dense/web/{crisp3ds-dense.js, pkg/*}` to `dist/engine/` when
  `pkg/` exists (`sh crates/dense/web/build.sh`: Rust with the
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and `wasm-bindgen-cli` 0.2.129). Without it
  `npm run build` still works with Node alone, and the card says the engine is
  not included. CI and the release build it.
- Inside the app this mode is a hidden diagnostic (`#/?diagnostics=1` shows
  the card, `=0` hides it): the built-in engine does the same job natively.

```sh
sh crates/dense/web/build.sh            # once, and after changes to crates/dense
cd apps/studio && npm run build && npm run preview &
npx playwright install chromium         # the full browser; the headless shell has no WebGPU
STUDIO_INPUTS=/path/to/inputs node scripts/browser-engine-check.mjs
```

## Architecture

```
sources  ──events──▶  reducer  ──state──▶  views
(replay | http | local | browser)  (pure)  (Preact components, three.js viewer)
```

```
src/
  core/        no DOM, no network; unit-tested
    events.ts      event type, log parsing (half-written last line is not consumed)
    reducer.ts     (state, event) -> state, plus selectors (sheet grouping, elapsed time, STL size)
    replay.ts      ReplayPlayer: recorded timing, speed, pause, scrub, step; clock injected
    settings.ts    settings form logic: text <-> typed values, diff against defaults, error placement
    reports.ts     report JSON -> rows; unknown shapes fall through to raw JSON
    stl.ts         binary STL -> indexed mesh (welded vertices, smooth normals, bounds), resumable
    format.ts      durations, sizes, counts
    startPoints.ts  the "New run" form from the engine's list: fields, provider choices, request body
    providerOptions.ts  options of the mask and camera providers of the photos start
  sources/     no DOM; `fetch` and timers injected; unit-tested
    types.ts       RunSource and Engine: the one interface the views use
    replaySource.ts   bundle -> ReplayPlayer -> updates
    httpEngine.ts     HttpEngine (health, settings, runs, start) and HttpRunSource (polling, files, cancel)
    localEngine.ts    the engine built into the app, over the shell's commands (injected bridge)
    browserEngine.ts  the engine in a worker of the page (injected worker), runs held in memory
    runStore.ts       folds a source's updates into RunState with the reducer
  browser/     the worker that loads the WebAssembly engine, and its message types
  viewer/      three.js; loaded on demand
    viewer.ts      scene, camera, controls, lighting, up axis, render on demand
    meshLoader.ts  download with progress, parse in a worker, LRU cache of parsed meshes
    stl.worker.ts  the worker
  ui/          Preact components and the stylesheet's class names
```

Things worth knowing:

- **One reducer.** Replay, HTTP, the built-in engine and the browser engine all deliver
  `{type: "events" | "reset" | "link"}` updates. `events` are appended;
  `reset` (replay scrubbing backwards) recomputes from the first event. Unknown
  event types, artifact kinds and fields are ignored; unknown stages are
  appended to the timeline; an unknown schema name gives a notice and the rest
  still works.
- **Polling.** `GET .../events?since=N` once a second. On an error the wait
  becomes 1, 2, 4, 8, then 15 s, the notice says why, and the cursor is kept,
  so nothing is lost or applied twice. `401`, `403` and `404` stop polling.
  Polling ends at `run_finished`.
- **Meshes.** Only the surface that is to be shown is downloaded. Parsing
  happens in a worker (in slices on the main thread if a worker cannot start).
  Identical vertices are welded, so a closed mesh takes about half of the
  STL's size in memory and smooth normals come for free; flat shading is done by the
  material on the same buffers. GPU buffers exist only for the mesh on screen
  and are disposed on every swap. Parsed meshes are cached up to 192 MB, least
  recently used first out.
- **The final mesh.** A binary STL is exactly `84 + 50 × triangles` bytes, so
  its size is known from the event; when `triangles` is missing the file is
  asked for its size with `HEAD`. Above 12 MB (or when neither says) the final
  mesh is not fetched until the "Load final surface (51 MB)" button is pressed;
  the newest preview stays on screen meanwhile.
- **Rendering on demand.** There is no animation loop; a still model costs
  nothing.

Transitive dependencies (about 365 crates are linked across all platforms) are
audited by `npm run licenses`, which writes
[`docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md`](docs/THIRD-PARTY-LICENSES.md) and
`docs/licenses.json`; CI fails on a license outside the policy. Current
result: **clean with obligations** (attribution, and four MPL-2.0 crates whose
source must stay available). To list them yourself: `npm ls --all --omit=dev`
and `cargo tree --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml -e normal`.

No UI kit, CSS framework or state library. `typescript-eslint` is not used
because it does not support TypeScript 7 yet.

## Verification

Unit tests (`npm test`, 140 tests; `cargo test` in `src-tauri`, 40 tests): the reducer on the recorded sphere run and
on unknown events, kinds, fields, stages and schema; half-written last lines;
replay timing, speeds, pause, scrub and step with a fake clock; the STL parser
on all four fixture meshes (triangle counts as announced, closed and
consistently oriented, Euler characteristic 2, same vertex count as the mesh
report) and on broken input; settings parsing, diffing and error placement;
HTTP polling, backoff and cursor handling, token handling, and the replay
source, with a fake `fetch`.

In a real browser (headless Chromium through Playwright), against the built
app:

```sh
npx playwright install --only-shell chromium
npm run build && npm run preview &
npm run screenshots                                   # replay
STUDIO_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8765/ STUDIO_ENGINE_INPUTS=sphere STUDIO_ENGINE_EXTRAS=1 \
  npm run screenshots                                 # live engine, see the script's header
```

The engine pass connects through the form, provokes a validation error, starts
a small synthetic run through the settings form, watches it live on a desktop
and a phone viewport at the same time, waits for the end, then cancels a second
run. It was also run against an engine started with `--token` (wrong token
refused with a clear message; images and meshes load with the right one).

### Large runs

Measured with `scripts/perf-check.mjs` on a real run: the Bunny bundle
(65 events; previews of 260 000 to 287 000 triangles, 13 to 14 MB each; final
STL 1 047 922 triangles, 52.4 MB; ten sheets up to 1800 px wide; a scanner
evaluation with a handedness warning). Apple M1, real GPU
(`STUDIO_GL=metal`), served from localhost, headless Chromium:

- only the newest preview is downloaded; the final mesh waits for its
  "Load final surface (52 MB)" button, at desktop and phone width;
- first surface on screen 0.35 to 0.5 s after opening the page (2.5 s on the
  very first, cold launch);
- the 52 MB final mesh on screen 1.0 s after the click, longest main-thread
  pause 54 ms;
- swapping between cached surfaces 50 to 120 ms; 30 orbit steps on the final
  mesh in 0.7 s;
- all three reports are summarised and the handedness warning is shown; no
  sideways scrolling at 390 px.

Nothing had to be changed for the real bundle. Its sheets are not megapixel
sized, so the thumbnail question stays open: a synthetic test with sheets
scaled to 4200 × 4200 worked, with a pause of 0.2 to 0.4 s when one is opened
at 1:1. Not measured: real phones, and memory on a device with little of it.

```sh
STUDIO_GL=metal STUDIO_BUNDLE=<address> STUDIO_OUT=<folder> node scripts/perf-check.mjs
```

## The app (Tauri 2)

`src-tauri/` wraps the same web app. Inside the app there are up to three
engines to choose from on the **Connection** screen:

| Engine | What it is | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **This computer** (default) | The reconstruction itself, `crates/dense`, linked into the app and running in its own process on the GPU (`wgpu`: Metal, DirectX 12, Vulkan). No Python. Starts from an inputs folder, from a camera solution with prepared images and raw masks, or from turntable photos (see below) | every build with the `native-engine` feature |
| **External Python engine** | The Python reference pipeline, started by the app as a child process with interpreters you installed (see below). For the plain-photos start, scoring against a scan, and comparisons | desktop builds with the `local-engine` feature; not possible in the App Sandbox |
| **Another engine** | Any engine by address and token, over HTTP | everywhere |

Recorded runs and the demo work everywhere too.

### How the built-in engine is wired

```
web view                         shell (Rust)                         crates/dense
LocalEngine / LocalRunSource ──invoke──▶ commands ──▶ native::Native ──thread──▶ run(options, observer, cancel)
        ▲                                                │
        └──────── events by line number, file bytes ◀────┴── <runs>/<id>/events.jsonl, sheets, meshes
```

- **Commands** (`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`), one per operation of the HTTP engine:
  `native_health` (with the start points), `native_settings`, `native_runs`,
  `native_start`, `native_events(id, since)`, `native_cancel`,
  `native_file(id, path)` (raw bytes), `native_file_size`, `native_data(path)`,
  plus `pick_path` for the native dialogs. The web side
  (`sources/localEngine.ts`) is the HTTP source with `invoke` in place of
  `fetch`, on an injected bridge so it is tested without Tauri.
- **Threading.** `native_start` checks the request (paths, settings through
  the crate's own validation), then runs `crisp3ds_dense::run::run` on a
  worker thread named `run-<id>` with a cancel flag, and returns the id once
  the first event is on disk. The crate meshes previews on a thread of its own.
  Commands that read files are asynchronous, so they never run on the main
  thread.
- **Events.** The log on disk is the only source of truth. The web view polls
  `native_events` every 400 ms with its line count, exactly as it polls an
  HTTP engine; nothing is pushed. A last line without a newline is not
  delivered.
- **Files** travel as bytes through `native_file`; images become object URLs.
  This was chosen over an asset protocol or custom URI scheme: it needs no
  extra permission, no CSP entry and no per-platform scheme, and the path
  check is in one place.
- **Paths.** Everything the web view names is relative to the runs folder or
  the data folder and is refused unless it stays inside (no `..`, no absolute
  or drive paths, no symbolic link leading out). The one exception: an
  absolute input path is accepted after the user picked it, or a folder above
  it, in a native dialog during this session.
- **Cancel** sets the flag and creates the run's `cancel` file. The crate
  looks at the flag between views and passes, so a Bunny run says "cancelled
  on request" within a fraction of a second to a few seconds.
- **A started log is always closed.** If the pipeline panics or returns
  without `run_finished`, the shell appends `error` and `run_finished`. On
  quitting, runs are asked to stop and given eight seconds; what is still busy
  is closed as cancelled because the process ends. (The crate stops computing
  at once, but returns only when the preview surface it is meshing is done,
  which on the Bunny took 0.5 to more than 8 s; so a quit takes between a
  moment and those eight seconds.) Runs that an earlier instance left open
  (they carry a `studio-run.json` marker) are closed as failed at the next
  start. Runs written by another engine into the same folder are left alone.
- **Settings form.** From the crate: `crisp3ds_dense::config::settings_schema()`
  (name, group, meaning, kind, default). Nothing is embedded in the shell.
- **Start points.** The "New run" form is built from the crate's
  `crisp3ds_dense::run::describe()` (`core/startPoints.ts`): "inputs folder",
  "camera solution, images and masks", and "turntable photos". The shell adds
  to each provider whether it can run on this computer, and why not.
- **The window keeps up when it is covered.** `backgroundThrottling` is
  disabled for the window: a web view that is behind other windows otherwise
  stops its timers after a while, and a run watched in it would stand still
  until the window is shown again.

### Starting from photos

"Turntable photos" takes a folder of photos and a lens calibration, makes
masks and cameras first (stages **Masks** and **Cameras** in the timeline,
with their numbers and the sheets "Masks on photos" and "Sparse points on
undistorted photos and masks") and then runs the dense stages.

- **Lens calibration.** Calibration files found in the data folder, in
  `calibrations/` under it and, from a checkout, in
  `scripts/turntable_mesh/calibrations/` are offered as buttons; any other
  file can be typed or picked.
- **Providers.** One choice for masks (`threshold`, `import`,
  `external-sam`) and one for cameras (`alicevision`, `colmap`, `markers`,
  `import`), from the crate's list. `markers` (a printed marker mat under the
  object, `docs/MARKER-MAT.md`) needs no external program, only the mat's
  description file; it was added to the form after the verification below
  and has not been run from the app. A provider that cannot run here is shown, disabled,
  with the reason ("AliceVision is not set up. See Tools."). `import` asks
  for the folder or file to import. Each provider's options are in the form,
  the common ones visible and the rest under "More options"; only values that
  differ from the default are sent.
- **Tools.** The Folders screen has a section per external tool: AliceVision
  (install folder and extra library folders), COLMAP (program), SAM 2.1
  (Python, source folder, checkpoint). They are saved with the other settings
  (or come from `CRISP3DS_ALICEVISION`, `CRISP3DS_ALICEVISION_LIBRARY_PATH`,
  `CRISP3DS_COLMAP`, `CRISP3DS_SAM_PYTHON`, `CRISP3DS_SAM_SOURCE`,
  `CRISP3DS_SAM_CHECKPOINT`). **Check** starts the tool once and shows its
  version or what went wrong.
- **What a request may say.** A start request names a provider and option
  values. It can never name a program or a place for one: those come from the
  Tools settings only, and option words that would (`--alicevision`,
  `--colmap`, `--python`, `--output`, ...) are refused. The assembled
  options are checked by the crate's own parser before the run starts.
- **Not in the sandboxed variant**: an App Sandbox app cannot start other
  programs. There the photos start offers `threshold` masks and imported
  masks and cameras only, and says why.

The provider options and the tool checks are written by hand in Studio
(`core/providerOptions.ts`, `src-tauri/src/tools.rs`), because the crate
describes providers but not their options and has no availability check. They
follow `crisp3ds-dense photos --help` and need updating when that changes.

Run ids are `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-<name>` in UTC (the Python engine uses local
time).

### Running it from a fresh clone

Needs Node 22.18+, a Rust toolchain (stable) and the
[Tauri 2 system prerequisites](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for
your OS (on Linux: `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev
libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libxdo-dev libssl-dev`). No Python
is needed to run the app.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/CrispStrobe/crisp3ds && cd crisp3ds/apps/studio
npm ci
npm run tauri dev          # or: npm run tauri build -- --debug --no-bundle
```

Then **New run**, and either **Choose** an inputs folder anywhere on the
computer, or put prepared photo sets into the data folder and **Browse**. A
scene to try is made by the Python reference
(`python -m scripts.turntable_mesh.synthetic_scene --output <folder>`, with
the small settings it prints); the app itself does not generate one.

Folders, first match wins: the **Folders** screen (saved as `config.json` in
the app's config folder), `CRISP3DS_RUNS_DIR` and `CRISP3DS_DATA_DIR`, then
`runs/` and `data/` in the app's data folder.

### The external Python engine (optional, desktop)

> **Python is not part of the app.** No Python, PyTorch or reconstruction code
> other than `crates/dense` is bundled.

Chosen on the Connection screen, the app starts

```
<python> -m scripts.turntable_mesh.engine_server --runs <dir> --data <dir> \
  --host 127.0.0.1 --port <free port> --token <random> --device <device> \
  --python <python> --torch-python <torch python>          (PYTHONPATH=<repo>, cwd=<repo>)
```

waits for `/api/health`, and talks to it over HTTP with the per-start token.
It is started only when chosen, and ended with its process group when the app
quits. Its settings (source folder, the two interpreters, device) are on the
same screen as the folders; they resolve from that screen, then
`CRISP3DS_REPO`, `CRISP3DS_PYTHON`, `CRISP3DS_TORCH_PYTHON`, then a checkout
above the executable with a `.venv` in it, then `python3` from `PATH`.
`auto` is `mps` on Apple Silicon and `cpu` elsewhere.

### What the web view is allowed to do

- Content Security Policy: scripts, styles and workers only from the app
  itself; `object-src 'none'`, no frames, no forms, no remote code.
  `connect-src` and `img-src` additionally allow `http:` and `https:` (and
  `blob:`, `data:` for images), because the same app must reach an engine on
  another machine and replay bundles on any server.
- Tauri capabilities: **none**. The window may call the shell's own commands
  and nothing else: no file system, shell, HTTP or dialog plugin access from
  JavaScript. The native pickers are opened by the Rust side.

### Variants

| Variant | Cargo features | Engines | For |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Desktop (default) | `native-engine`, `local-engine` | built-in, external Python, remote | direct download |
| Mac App Store | `--no-default-features --features native-engine` | built-in (no AliceVision, COLMAP or SAM), remote | sandboxed builds: a sandboxed app cannot start other programs. A folder chosen with a dialog has to be chosen again after a restart: Tauri does not offer security-scoped bookmarks, and the Folders screen says so |
| Client only | `--no-default-features` | remote | fallback if the engine cannot be shipped on a platform |
| Phones | default (the Python launcher is never compiled for phones) | built-in (untested), remote | Android, iOS |

Store files: `src-tauri/tauri.appstore.conf.json`,
`src-tauri/entitlements.appstore.plist` (`app-sandbox`,
`files.user-selected.read-write`, `network.client`), `src-tauri/Info.plist`
and `Info.ios.plist`. Nothing has been uploaded anywhere; see
[`docs/RELEASING.md`](../../docs/RELEASING.md).

### How it was verified, and what was not

Apple M1, macOS, debug build (`tauri build --debug --no-bundle`: the real
`tauri://` origin and the production CSP; the crate itself optimised). The
app's own form was driven by `scripts/autopilot-run.js`, which a **debug**
build runs inside its web view when `CRISP3DS_STUDIO_AUTOPILOT=<file>` is set.

Through the app's own form, built-in engine:

- Synthetic sphere (inputs found with the folder browser, eleven settings
  typed): **Complete** in 2 s. Hull, level-1 surface and final surface appeared
  in the 3D view in turn, 8 of 8 sheets loaded, photo check and mesh report
  shown, no CSP violation; 232 MB peak resident memory.
- A second sphere run **cancelled** with the Cancel run button: the log ends
  with `cancelled on request` and `run_finished: cancelled`, and the view says
  so.
- Quitting: the app exits by itself with code 0, no process is left, and the
  run folders are complete (`events.jsonl`, `pipeline.json`, sheets, meshes).

In the app's process but **not through the window** (debug hook
`CRISP3DS_STUDIO_AUTORUN`, because the computer's screen was locked for the
rest of the session and a hidden web view does not run its timers):

- **Bunny, default settings, once**: complete in 339 s (stereo 273 s, mesh
  38 s, check 28 s), four preview meshes, ten sheets, final mesh and both
  reports on disk, **2.8 GB peak resident memory**. The machine was busy (load
  average 17) and this is a debug build of everything but the crate; the
  crate's own figures for a release build are 1.5 to 3 minutes. A release
  build of the app was not timed (disk space).
- **Sandboxed variant**, ad-hoc signed with the three entitlements: the
  synthetic sphere reconstructed inside the sandbox in 8 s, with runs and data
  in the app's container.

Afterwards, with the screen unlocked, that finished Bunny run was opened in
the app: five surfaces in the step strip, the newest preview (260 708
triangles) shown by itself, the final mesh behind its "Load final surface
(52 MB)" button and on screen 0.7 s after the click (1 047 200 triangles,
longest page pause 34 ms), 9 of 9 sheets, photo check and mesh report. The
runs list, the New run form with both start points, the Folders screen and
the Connection screen were looked at in window captures.

Not verified:

- **The Bunny live in the window**: that its previews and sheets appear while
  it runs, and that the window stays responsive meanwhile. Live progress in
  the window was verified on the sphere only (the Bunny was to be run once,
  and that run happened while the screen was locked).
- **Clicking**: the native pickers (and with them the absolute-path grant in a
  real session), the Folders screen, switching engines on the Connection
  screen, the "camera solution, images and masks" start, and the external
  Python engine after this change (its Rust tests pass).
- **Windows and Linux**: built and unit-tested in CI only. The CI runners have
  no GPU for wgpu on Linux, so the test run there ends with the engine's
  "no GPU adapter" error, which is the clean failure the app shows; on the
  macOS runner it completes on the virtual Metal device, and on the Windows
  runner on DirectX 12's software adapter. Nobody has run the app itself on
  Windows or Linux, so the window, and DirectX 12 or Vulkan on real hardware,
  are untried there.
- **Android and iOS**: the debug APK and the simulator app compile and link
  with the engine in CI. They were never installed or started.
- Starting two runs at once (nothing prevents it; they would share the GPU),
  and quitting during a long stage (covered by a unit test with a stand-in
  pipeline only).

Process handling of the external Python engine is unchanged and still
untested on Windows (`taskkill /T /F`, which also kills a run in progress)
and Linux (process group; a run in progress survives the app).

### Round five: photos, live Bunny, sandbox, quitting

Same machine, debug build, the app's own form driven by the autopilot in the
window (screen unlocked), unless said otherwise.

- **Bunny from photos, once** (73 photos, calibration `3dlf-pro.json` picked
  from the offered list, masks `threshold`, cameras `alicevision`, AliceVision
  folder and library folder from the Tools settings): **Complete**, 1 064 830
  triangles, silhouette overlap 0.967, 73 of 73 views registered, reprojection
  median 0.43 px. Masks 21 s, cameras 24 min 46 s, stereo 3 min 04 s, mesh
  30 s, check 11 s. The machine was heavily loaded by other work (load average
  up to 80), which is where the camera stage's time went. The request the form
  sent was read back from the run's `pipeline.json`:
  `--calibration <3dlf-pro.json> --masks threshold --cameras alicevision
  --alicevision <folder> --alicevision-library-path /opt/homebrew/lib`.
  The timeline showed Masks and Cameras with their numbers while they ran.
  The owner was working at the computer; when another window covered the
  app, its web view stopped updating at 97 % of stereo and the script never
  finished (this is what led to `backgroundThrottling`). The finished run was
  then opened in the window: 11 of 11 sheets loaded, including "Masks on
  photos" and "Sparse points", three reports, no CSP violation.
- **Tools screen**: Check pressed for all three. AliceVision: "Works.
  AliceVision 3.4 starts."; COLMAP and SAM, not installed here: "Does not
  work." with the reason.
- **Bunny live in the window**, inputs folder, default settings: Complete in
  153 s (stereo 130 s, mesh 13 s, check 9 s), 2.25 GB peak resident. Hull,
  repaired hull and both level surfaces appeared in the 3D view while it ran,
  sheets one by one (9 of 9); the longest pause of the page was 0.39 s. The
  final mesh (1 047 200 triangles) loaded from its button.
- **Sandboxed variant** (ad-hoc signed app bundle with the three
  entitlements), through its form: sphere Complete in 5 s with runs and data
  in the container. Folders screen: a data folder typed, **Save** pressed,
  the app restarted, the folder was still there. The photos start listed
  `external-sam`, `alicevision` and `colmap` as not available.
- **Switching engines** on the Connection screen (this computer, the
  diagnostic browser engine, back): done by the script. WebGPU is there in
  the app's web view on this Mac; no run was made with it there.
- **Quitting during a Bunny run**, three times: the engine said "cancelled on
  request" 0.2 to 4.7 s after the quit; the process was gone after 6.5 to
  8.2 s (see "A started log is always closed"). Cancelling with the button
  ended the run in 0.6 s.

**This browser**, headless Chromium 153 with WebGPU on Metal, through the
app's own screens (`scripts/browser-engine-check.mjs`):

- Synthetic sphere, eleven settings typed: Complete in 6 s, three surfaces
  and 8 sheets shown, STL downloaded (33 836 triangles), a sheet downloaded,
  all 8 object URLs dead after leaving the run view. A second run cancelled
  with the button: "The run was cancelled during stereo."
- **Bunny** (a self-contained copy of the inputs folder: 148 files, 147
  megapixels; intermediate surfaces off by the rule above): Complete in
  **250 s** (stereo 186 s, mesh 38 s, check 26 s), **1.9 GiB** peak
  WebAssembly memory, downloaded STL **1 047 356 triangles** (52 367 884
  bytes), 9 sheets.

Still not verified:

- **The native pickers.** They need a person's click; the path grant behind
  them is unit-tested. Typing a path and the folder browser were used instead.
- **Photos with COLMAP, SAM or the marker mat**, and the `import` providers, through the
  window: neither tool is installed here. The request building is unit-tested
  against the crate's parser.
- A run in the browser engine in Safari or Firefox, on a phone, or inside the
  app's web view; picking with the File System Access dialog (the test uses
  the folder input, which is always present).
- Windows and Linux as before: built and unit-tested in CI only.

## Releases## Releases

`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the web bundle, the bundled desktop
apps, the mobile probes and the pipeline's source archive, and on a `v*` tag
creates a **draft prerelease**. The desktop bundles contain the engine: they
reconstruct from cameras and masks with nothing else installed, and from
plain photos when AliceVision or COLMAP is installed. The web bundle contains
the engine for browsers. `scripts/set-version.mjs` keeps
`package.json`, `tauri.conf.json` and `Cargo.toml` on one version. Signing is
off until its secrets exist: `APPLE_CERTIFICATE`,
`APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY`, `APPLE_ID`,
`APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID` (macOS), `WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE`,
`WINDOWS_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` (Windows). The procedure is in
[`docs/RELEASING.md`](../../docs/RELEASING.md).

## Implemented, and not

Implemented: everything under [What it shows](#what-it-shows); the replay and
HTTP, local and browser sources; the demo; the app with the built-in engine
(including the photos start and the Tools screen) and the optional launcher
for the external Python engine.

Not implemented:

- **Photo upload and capture.** Not in the contract yet, so a phone cannot
  send photos.
- **Masks and cameras without external programs.** The photos start needs
  AliceVision or COLMAP for cameras (or an imported solution); only the
  `threshold` masks are built in. The browser engine starts from an inputs
  folder only.
- **Scoring against a reference scan** with the built-in engine (the Python
  engine does it).
- **Remembering a picked folder across restarts** in the sandboxed variant:
  Tauri offers no security-scoped bookmarks, and reaching for them through
  unsafe platform calls was not done. The Folders screen says so.
- **Thumbnails and compact meshes.** Gallery cards show the full sheet scaled
  down; the contract has no thumbnail or decimated-mesh artifact yet.
- **Deleting or renaming runs**: no endpoint. (The STL and the sheets have
  Download buttons, except in the app, where they are files in the runs
  folder.)
- **Engine discovery on the network** (mDNS or a QR code with address and
  token), so nobody types an address on a phone.
- **Push updates.** Studio polls, as the contract says.
- **Mesh formats other than binary STL.** A text STL is refused with a clear
  message.
- **Installable PWA / offline shell**: no service worker.
- **Translations.** English only.
- **Asking before quitting while a run is in progress.**

Runs recorded before the engine announced the photo check as a `report`
artifact still show it: for those, a live engine is asked for
`check/result.json` by its conventional path once the check stage is done.
