# Rendered turntable photos of Google Scanned Objects

Turntable photo sequences **rendered** from a few objects of
[Google Scanned Objects](https://goo.gle/scanned-objects), for trying photo-to-3D reconstruction
without a camera. The photos are synthetic: each scanned, textured mesh stands on a light disc in
front of a light backdrop and is seen from one ring of 72 cameras 20 degrees above it (5 degree
steps), through a real lens model (the 3DLF apiCAM PRO lens with its radial distortion), at
1749 x 1155 pixels, with one light that keeps its place relative to the camera, a cast shadow,
1 px Gaussian blur and mild noise. Rendered by `crisp3ds-dense render` of
[Crisp 3D Studio](https://github.com/CrispStrobe/crisp3ds), which uses them as downloadable
example objects.

| Object | Title | Source model | Photos | Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
{table}

Layout: `<object>/rgb/<object>_<n>_rgb.png` in capture order and
`calibration/render-3dlf-lens.json` (the lens the photos were rendered with, in Crisp3DS's
`crisp3ds_lens_calibration_v1` format; exact for these photos). `manifest.json` lists every file
with its size and SHA-256.
