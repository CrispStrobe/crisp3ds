# Photo-only regression checks

Run cases serially through masks, recovered turntable cameras, stereo and mesh.
With `--texture`, export GLB from each resulting STL and verify every triangle
coordinate and winding byte. Reference meshes, supplied poses, dataset masks
and dataset depths must not be reconstruction inputs. The caller must verify
photo provenance; the runner cannot establish it from a directory name.

```sh
python scripts/photo_regression/run.py --manifest cases.json \
  --binary /path/to/crisp3ds-dense --output /path/to/new-results --texture
```

Example local manifest (paths resolve beside the manifest):

```json
{"cases": [
  {"id": "light-object", "photos": "capture/photos", "calibration": "capture/lens.json",
   "masks": "background", "require_closed": true,
   "minimum_textured_area_fraction": 0.6,
   "attribution": "The capture's required attribution"}
]}
```

`masks` may be `threshold`, experimental `background`, or native `sam` (requires
an appropriate build/model/runtime). Optional `photo_options` contains CLI
arguments such as `--turntable-region=surface`; data/provider overrides and
imported match caches are refused. Surface recovery is experimental, requires
one roughly uniform full turn with moving planar support features, and has
not yet produced acceptable mustard geometry.

Results retain logs, reports, masks and meshes. The free-space threshold defaults
to 9 GiB; reconstruction stops if crossed. An open mesh fails unless the case
explicitly sets `require_closed: false`, for example for unobserved undersides.
A PASS means execution, closure (when requested), texture coverage and geometry
preservation passed. It does **not** mean the shape is accurate. Render and
review untextured meshes and score against an independent reference separately.
Texture coverage also does not establish colour accuracy.

Run the geometry-check test with:

```sh
python -m unittest discover -s scripts/photo_regression -p 'test_*.py'
```

## Camera observations reserved before recovery

`camera_holdout.py partition --matches photo-matches.json --output split`
removes entire connected match components, including ambiguous ones. Recover
cameras using `split/training-matches.json`, then run:

```sh
python scripts/photo_regression/camera_holdout.py evaluate \
  --matches photo-matches.json --reserved split/reserved-tracks.json \
  --cameras recovered/cameras.json --calibration lens.json --output scores
```

The evaluator triangulates alternating observations and scores the others.
It reports all reserved observations and a subset selected using only the
fitting observations (at least three, each below 1 px). Bad correspondences
remain visible in the full report. This is a camera diagnostic, not a dense
accuracy gate. Matches must use the original calibrated photo coordinates;
calibration is the engine's `radialk3` model. Do not fit with the original cache.

Add `--foreground-masks` to `evaluate` to report errors separately inside and
outside the recovered cameras' photo-derived masks. The masks must match each
camera's image dimensions; normalized feature coordinates are mapped using
that camera's intrinsics. These groups do not alter triangulation, track
selection or the overall scores. Report group counts: a small number of good
object observations cannot establish accuracy everywhere, and incorrect masks
can misclassify observations. Points beyond the mask bounds form a separate
group rather than being counted as background.

When comparing recovered cameras, add
`--selection-cameras baseline/cameras.json` to **both** evaluations. This freezes
verified-track eligibility using the baseline's fitting observations, without
looking at the held-out observations. Candidate points are still triangulated
with candidate cameras. Use only your own recovered baseline cameras; supplied
dataset poses must not select the subset. The ordered view names must match.
Both baseline and candidate cameras must have been recovered with the same
partitioned training cache, excluding all reserved components. A baseline
recovered with the original full cache would leak the held-out observations.

Report `fit_verified_selected_observations` and
`fit_verified_invalid_observations` alongside the errors. A candidate with
behind-camera or untriangulatable selected observations must not gain credit
by dropping those observations from its percentiles. Fixed-subset comparisons
require zero invalid selected observations. The full reserved-track and
foreground reports remain necessary: a better selected median with a worse
tail or full foreground error does not establish better cameras for stereo.

## Local relief through the stages

`detail_profiles.py --spec regions.json --output new-folder` compares raw,
filtered and merged depth maps and meshes with an independently aligned scanner.
Scanner geometry is read only by this evaluation script. It never writes
reconstruction inputs. NumPy/SciPy are required; plots also need Matplotlib
(or pass `--no-plots`). A specification contains:

```json
{"cameras":"own-inputs/cameras.json", "evaluation_reference_stl":"aligned-scan.stl",
 "regions":[{"name":"eye","view":"view_10","crop":[1048,505,90,90]}],
 "depths":{"raw":{"archive":"stereo/depths-pass-0-raw.npz",
                     "metadata":"stereo/depths-stage-cameras.json"}},
 "meshes":{"final":"mesh/mesh.stl"}}
```

Select and inspect boxes on the source photographs first. Crops are original
photo coordinates, mapped through each stage's actual intrinsics. Reports
include coverage, ray-depth error, inverse-depth relief after plane detrending,
and Gaussian high-pass relief at 2/4/8 px. Each stage has its own common-ray
statistics and a second comparison restricted to the same rays across **all**
stages. Filtered depths equal raw values where retained, so on the fixed
intersection they can have identical errors while coverage falls. Report both.
Alignment error, crop boundaries and missing data can affect these measures;
a gain or correlation is not proof that an eye or nose has been recovered.

## Independent stereo and surface evidence controls

`stereo_control.py` runs the installed OpenCV CPU SGBM implementation on pairs
of original lens-undistorted RGB photos, using your own masks, recovered cameras
and sparse points. It does not read native stereo depth as search data. OpenCV
is an optional diagnostic dependency; it is not added to the app. Inputs must
have a common pinhole canvas and native-resolution crop metadata from
`CRISP3DS_STAGE_DEPTHS=1`. Keep original RGB paths in the control's
`cameras.json`, rather than contrast-preprocessed matching images.

```sh
python scripts/photo_regression/stereo_control.py \
  --inputs own-original-rgb-inputs \
  --stage-cameras native-run/stereo/depths-stage-cameras.json \
  --output new-independent-stereo --pair-gap 4 --threads 2
```

The output `depths.npz` can be replayed through native fusion with
`run --reuse-depths new-independent-stereo/depths.npz`. Compare both its depth
points and its mesh on frozen evaluation alignment. This is two-view SGBM,
not an external COLMAP MVS or SOTA benchmark; differences in preprocessing,
regularization and selected source views remain. The original control uses
one source per reference, a five-pixel block, two-sided disparity verification
at one pixel, sparse-derived disparity bounds and nearest Z-buffer reprojection.
An independently generated plane with an eight-pixel disparity tests the
conversion from rectified disparity to original camera Z.

`surface_support.py` samples a mesh by triangle area and counts its own depth
observations within the actual fusion truncation. It reads no scanner. Pass
truncation and behind-band distances in scene units, not voxels:

```sh
python scripts/photo_regression/surface_support.py \
  --mesh native-run/mesh/mesh.stl --cameras own-inputs/cameras.json \
  --stage-cameras native-run/stereo/depths-stage-cameras.json \
  --depths native-run/stereo/depths.npz \
  --truncation 0.003 --behind-distance 0.012 --output support.json
```

Use the run's actual distances. Samples are after mesh smoothing/extrapolation,
not exact fused voxel centres; mask-rim erosion is omitted, so observations
are an upper bound on production support. A supporting depth is not proof of
correct geometry. Far free-space votes, weak behind-surface votes and direct
near-surface observations are counted separately. No automatic acceptance
threshold or default change follows from this diagnostic.
